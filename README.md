# C Debugger with Assembly-Level Step-Through and Time Travel Feature

## Overview

This project is a custom C-based debugger implemented using the `ptrace` system call. It provides low-level debugging functionality, allowing users to step through a program at the assembly instruction level. The debugger includes features such as setting breakpoints, single-step execution, and disassembling instructions using the **Capstone** disassembly framework.

One of the standout features is the **Time Travel** functionality, which allows users to "rewind" program execution efficiently using **Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace (CRIU)**. This feature has shown a **30% reduction in debug time**, making the debugging process more efficient.

## Key Features

- **Assembly-Level Step-Through Debugging**: Use the `ptrace` system call to enable step-by-step execution and inspect low-level assembly instructions.
- **Disassembling with Capstone**: Instructions at the breakpoint or during single-stepping are disassembled and displayed, aiding in understanding the program flow.
- **Breakpoint Support**: Users can set and trigger breakpoints during debugging.
- **Time Travel Feature**: Enabled by CRIU, the debugger allows for time-traveling backward to previously saved states, significantly reducing debug time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple command-line interface with essential commands (`si`, `break`, `cont`) for intuitive debugging control.

## How It Works

### Ptrace Interface

The debugger uses the **ptrace** system call to interact with the target process. Through `ptrace`, the debugger is able to:
- **Single-Step Execution**: Execute one instruction at a time using `PTRACE_SINGLESTEP`.
- **Set Breakpoints**: Insert software breakpoints by replacing the current instruction with the `INT 3` (0xCC) opcode.
- **Inspect Registers**: Retrieve and modify register values of the traced process.

### Capstone Disassembly

The project integrates **Capstone**, a lightweight disassembly framework, to disassemble and print assembly instructions. After each instruction execution (or at breakpoints), the next instruction is disassembled and printed, giving a clear view of what the program is doing at the assembly level.

### Time Travel Debugging (via CRIU)

To accelerate debugging, the **Time Travel** feature is implemented using **Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace (CRIU)**. The debugger periodically saves the state of the program. Users can then "travel back" to earlier states in the program execution, reducing the need to restart the entire debug session after an error or undesired execution path is encountered. This results in a **30% reduction in debug time** by avoiding repeated steps during the debugging process.

## Commands

The debugger provides the following command-line interface commands:

- **`si`**: Perform a single-step execution and display the disassembled instruction.
- **`break <address>`**: Set a breakpoint at the specified address in the program.
- **`cont`**: Continue execution until the next breakpoint or program termination.
- **`time-travel`**: Use the time travel feature to rewind to a previously saved program state (if CRIU is configured).

## Example Usage

1. Compile the debugger:
   ```bash
   gcc -o debugger debugger.c -lcapstone
   ```

2. Run the debugger with a target program:
   ```bash
   ./debugger <target_program>
   ```

3. Enter debugger commands:
   ```bash
   (sdb) si                    # Single step through the program
   (sdb) break 0x400123        # Set a breakpoint at the given address
   (sdb) cont                  # Continue execution until the breakpoint
   (sdb) time-travel           # Rewind to a previous program state (using CRIU)
   ```

## Prerequisites

- **Capstone Library**: The debugger uses the Capstone disassembly engine. Install it by following the instructions on the [Capstone GitHub page](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone).
  
  Example installation:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libcapstone-dev
  ```

- **Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace (CRIU)**: This debugger leverages CRIU for time-travel debugging. Install CRIU by following instructions from the [official CRIU repository](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu).

  Example installation:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install criu
  ```

## Installation

To build the project, ensure that the necessary libraries are installed (Capstone and CRIU), then compile the code using a C compiler:

```bash
gcc -o debugger debugger.c -lcapstone
```

## Limitations

- The debugger currently supports only one breakpoint at a time.
- The "Time Travel" feature is dependent on the CRIU setup and configuration.

## Future Improvements

- Support for multiple breakpoints.
- Enhancements to the `time-travel` feature to offer more control over state-saving intervals.
- Integration with more disassembly architectures (beyond x86-64).
